## 🧠 AI Prompt Strategy

**Controlled Prompt Injection**

- `WonderWorld.md` acts as the **single source of truth**
- `chatbot.txt`enforces strict responses rules:
   - No hallucinations
   - Cheerful, concise tone
   - Clarifying questions when needed
   - Official ticket link for pricing questions

```
Use the park information below as the only source of truth.
Do not invent information.
```

This ensures **trustworthy, production-style AI behaviour.**

---

## 🔄 Conversation Continuity

- Each user session generates a unique **conversationId**
- Previous response IDs are stored in memory
- Enables contextual follow-up questions

Note: In-memory storage resets on server restart (intentional simplicity for demo purposes)
